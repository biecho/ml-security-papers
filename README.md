# Model Stealing Papers

A curated, auto-updated collection of academic papers on model stealing and model extraction attacks.

## What is Model Stealing?

Model stealing (or model extraction) attacks aim to replicate the functionality of a machine learning model by querying its API. Attackers can create a surrogate model that mimics the target's behavior without access to the original training data or model architecture.

## How it Works

This repository automatically:
1. Searches academic databases for papers matching keywords like "model stealing", "model extraction attack", etc.
2. Filters results by keyword relevance in title/abstract
3. Generates a static website with searchable, sortable paper listings
